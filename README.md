# Re-configurable Mesh Network with Limited UAVs Simulation

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks can provide coverage to users in areas where infrastructure is not available. Each UAV forms a circular area in which they serve the users. Limited resources can introduce constraints in the number of UAVs available to serve the coverage area. Along with efficient deployment and dispatch based on the assumption that the region has already been explored, this paper presents an approach to handle the problem of limitations in available UAVs when forming a dynamic mesh network. The approach uses a greedy algorithm that runs dynamically to re-position to provide Internet services to the maximum number of users for as long as possible.
